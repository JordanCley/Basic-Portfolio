            I'm 33 years old and was born in Kokomo, Indiana. I moved to Los Angeles originally for dancing and skating.
            A little back story, I was on the first season of America's Best Dance Crew and I breakdance on roller 
            skates. I know, kind of crazy!

            I got into coding a little over a year ago. I downloaded an app on my phone and started messing around with
            the activities when I was bored. Within a week I was hooked! I've been self-teaching myself since then. I've 
            learned alot on my own, but I took the leap and enrolled in the UCLA Coding Bootcamp to learn in class and 
            to build a network of people in the industry. I love my journey so far and I'm overly excited to see where 
            I go from here!
