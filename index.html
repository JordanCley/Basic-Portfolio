            <span>I</span> 'm 33 years old and was born in Kokomo, Indiana. I moved to Los Angeles originally for dancing and skating.
            A little back story, I was on the first season of America's Best Dance Crew and I breakdance on roller 
            skates. I know, kind of crazy!

            I got into coding a little over a year ago. I downloaded an app on my phone and started messing around with
            the activities when I was bored. Within a week I was hooked! I've been self-teaching myself since then. I've 
            learned alot on my own, but I took the leap and enrolled in the UCLA Coding Bootcamp to learn in class and 
            to build a network of people in the industry. I love my journey so far and I'm overly excited to see where 
            I go from here!

            Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's 
            standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to 
            make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic 
            typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset 
            sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus 
            PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
